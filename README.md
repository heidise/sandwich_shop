## Running the application
Clone the repository to your local machine
```
git clone https://course-gitlab.tuni.fi/compcs510-spring2024/crazepiano.git
```
Navigate to the root directory of the project
```
cd crazepiano
```
Build Docker images and start the containers
```
docker-compose up  
```
You can verify that the containers are running by using
```
docker-compose ps
```
Stop container
```
docker-compose down
```
Data saved to MongoDB is mounted to a local directory and persists between restarts.
## Accessing the application
Once the application is running, you can access it as follows:

**Server-a**: http://localhost:8080. The backend API used to place sandwich orders. Documentation available at the http://localhost:8080/docs endpoint

**Server-b**: Does not expose any ports to the host machine.

**Frontend**: http://localhost:80. React application hosted on nginx.

**RabbitMQ**: Does not expose any ports to the host machine.

**MongoDB**: Does not expose any ports to the host machine.

## Build with
### Frontend
- React: frontend framework
### Backend
- Node.js: backend runtime
- Mongoose: ORM
- RabbitMQ: AMPQ message broker
- Express: REST API framework
### Database
- MongoDB
### Containerization
- Docker

## Order status updates

There are `5` possible states for the order. Initially it is set to as `ordered` and added to `message-queue-A`. On succesful `ack` it is changed to `inQueue` and `failed` otherwise. When `server-b` begins processing the order, order status is set to `received` and added to `message-queue-B`. When processing is done, the status is set to `ready` and added to `message-queue-B`.

Considerations:
* If `server-A` fails to receive messages from `message-queue-B`, order status will not be updated correctly
